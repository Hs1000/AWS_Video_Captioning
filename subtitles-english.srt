00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,960
welcome to the data engineering Nano degree program. I'm

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,879
Sam and I'm a product Lee, that udacity.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,559
I worked with a great team of industry experts and

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,500
curriculum designers to put this program together, and I'm

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,929
very excited to have you join us. So why

6
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,500
Data engineering? Dave Engineering plays a vital role in

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,679
storing, organizing and making use of data. The

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,269
speed and volume of information we generate every day is

9
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,870
incredible. Every time you open your phone, click

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,350
an app or make a purchase, you're creating data

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,480
. Many of the products we use on a daily

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,609
basis are powered by this data. And companies across

13
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:37,060
industries are scrambling to reinvent themselves in order to use

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,810
data to better serve their customers, build better products

15
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,159
and even make the world a better place. Data

16
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,079
engineers are crucial to this effort. The pipelines they

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,810
build databases they design are the foundation that all other

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,320
analytics, data science and artificial intelligence efforts are built

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,549
on. Without this important work, data simply sits

20
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:59,740
in a data center and takes up space. Having

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,289
strong data engineers is one of the first and most

22
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,319
important steps in the digital transformation process. When working

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,129
with big data. There are dozens of tools to

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:10,189
choose from, and it can get confusing fast.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,379
This program will help you understand the big data ecosystem

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,900
and build your fluency in a modern set of tools

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,040
. The curriculum was designed with input from several expert

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,500
data engineers from some of the most advanced data driven

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,290
companies in the world, and each of the instructors

30
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,450
has extensive experience in this field. As a result

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,060
, the skills you learn are directly applicable. Toe

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,090
what data engineers do on the job. During the

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,569
program, you'll learn to model data, build production

34
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,409
, ready data warehouses and data lakes, process massive

35
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,549
amounts of data using modern tools and automate data pipelines

36
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,859
. Along the way, you'll build a set of

37
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,750
projects with guidance from mentors. These projects are designed

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,810
to imitate what you do on the job as it

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,420
it ends here, and every project you submit gets

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,280
reviewed, and our project viewers will provide personalized feedback

41
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,010
on how you can improve your work. These projects

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,159
will serve as a portfolio you can use to demonstrate

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
your skills. After completing the program, you'll be

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,430
prepared to land a job as a data engineer or

45
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,120
bring these crucial skills to your current role. We're

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,919
excited and honored that you're taking this step in your

47
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,879
journey with us.
